# CreativeDropdownMenus
Showcase of some cool looking dropdown menus built using only HTML and CSS.

## Motivation
I was interesting on CSS animations so I built this simple navbar to learn more about keyframes and how I can use them.

## Credits
The code is based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIdslaUj9wg) from DevTips youtube channel.
